# The Influence of Bicycle Paths on the Use of Rental Bikes in Munich

## Abstract
The use of rental bikes or bikes in general is an important topic as the car-heavy urban transport of the past, with its high CO2 emissions, must be transformed into the climate-neutral, low-energy transportation of the future. Thus, the bicycle represents the best solution for the reduction of climate damage in the mobility sector.

This project analyzes two data sets, one about the use of rental bikes from the "Münchner Verkehrsgesellschaft mbH" (MVG, Munich Transport Company) and the other about bicycle paths in Munich from the "Baureferat der Landeshauptstadt München" (Building Department of the City of Munich). The results of this project work provide insights into the interplay between urban bicycle infrastructure and the use of rental bike services in large cities as Munich, using "MVG Rad" (MVG bike) as an example.
